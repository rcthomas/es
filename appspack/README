DESCRIPTION:

  APPS is an asynchronous parallel pattern search method for
  optimization. Pattern search uses only function values for
  optimization, so it can be applied to a wide variety of problems. Of
  particular interest to us are engineering optimization design
  problems characterized by a small number of variables and by
  expensive objective function evaluations (typically complex
  simulations that take minutes or hours to run). The name "pattern
  search" derives from the fact that a pattern of search directions is
  used to drive the search. Parallelism is achieved by dividing the
  search directions (and corresponding function evaluations) among the
  different processors. The "asynchronous" part comes about as a
  consequence of the fact that the search along each direction
  continues without waiting for searches along other directions to
  finish, in contrast to the standard parallel pattern search method.

SUPPORT FOR THIS WORK:

  This research was sponsored by the Mathematical, Information, and
  Computational Sciences Division at the United States Department of
  Energy and by Sandia National Laboratory, a multiprogram laboratory
  operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the
  United States Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

DOWNLOADING APPSPACK

1. Go to http://software.sandia.gov/appspack/
2. Click on "APPSPACK License, Version, and Download Information"
3. Click on "APPSPACK Version 5.0.1" 
4. When prompted, save the file appspack-5.0.1.tar.gz to disk.

UNPACKING APPSPACK

To unpack the compressed tar file, type

  gunzip -c appspack-5.0.1.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

This will create a directory named appspack-5.0.1 containing the
source code for APPSPACK. Rename this directory appspack.  The full
path of the resulting appspack directory will be referred to as
${APPSPACK} for the remainder of this file..

CONFIGURING APPSPACK

The next step is configuring APPSPACK for your computing environment.
To do this, go to the ${APPSPACK} directory and type

  ./configure [options]

A full list of configure options can be obtained by typing 

  configure --help 

or by consulting the online documentation. The most important option
is

  --with-mpi-compilers[=PATH]

which specifies that the MPI compilers (mpicc, mpif77, and mpicxx or
mpiCC) should be used. The optional variable PATH designates the
location of these compilers.  Specifying the path is useful when
multiple versions of MPI are available.  If no path is indicated, the
compilers found in the default path are used.  If APPSPACK is
configured without any MPI options, only the serial version will be
compiled and installed.

Once APPSPACK has been successfully configured, the libraries and
executables can be built.  To compile APPSPACK, go to the 
${APPSPACK} directory, and type

  make

Assuming that an MPI configure option was specified, the make command
will create both the serial and MPI executables:

  ${APPSPACK}/src/appspack_serial
  ${APPSPACK}/src/appspack_mpi

The APPSPACK library ${APPSPACK}/src/libappspack.a will also be
created, and several examples will be compiled in the
${APPSPACK}/examples directory.

INSTALLING APPSPACK

Optionally, APPSPACK can be installed via the make install
command. The default installation location is /usr/local, but this can
be changed using the --prefix configure option. The executables
appspack\_serial and appspack\_mpi are installed in the bin
subdirectory, the header files are installed in the include
subdirectory, and the library is installed in the lib directory. The
examples are not installed.
