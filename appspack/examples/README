HOW TO RUN THE APPSPACK EXAMPLES


o General information on running APPSPACK is provided in the Doxygen
  documentation (included with this package and available online)
  under "Using the APPSPACK Executables".

o To run an example in serial, type

    appspack_serial example1.apps

  You may need to include the path to the serial version, e.g.,

    ../src/appspack_serial example1.apps

o To run an example in MPI, the command line will depend on which MPI
  you are using. In MPICH, the command looks like

    mpirun -np 5 appspack_mpi example1.apps

  (The path the appspack_mpi may need to be specified here as well.)


o Sample output has been included for each example (e.g.,
  example1.out) *but* your results may vary due to the asynchronism in
  APPSPACK.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLES


o Example 1 is written in C. It's objective function is

	f(x) = sum i * x_i^2.
  
  It also has bound constraints in example1.apps

o Example 2 is written in C++. It has the same objective function as 
  Example 1 but also includes the nonlinear constraint

	sum x_i^2 >= 1

  It also has  bound constraints in example2.apps.

o Example 3 is written in C++. It uses the objective function

	sum x_i^2

  with constraints

	(x_1)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2 + (x_3)^2 < 3
	(x_1 - 2)^2 + (x_2)^2 + (x_3)^2 < 3

  It also has bound constraints in example3.apps.
